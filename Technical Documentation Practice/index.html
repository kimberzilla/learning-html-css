    <p>Have a go at searching using some of the keywords youâ€™ve identified and adapt your search as you go along, depending on what you find.</p>
<p>If you don't find anything within a reasonable time period, e.g. 30 minutes, be prepared to change your strategy. For example, use different words to search or use a different resource.</p>
<p>You can add keywords to make your search more specific if you have too many results. If you find too few results, try removing words to make your search broader.</p>
Most search tools give you the option to filter your search results by subject or resource type. Try using these to increase the relevancy of your search results and reduce the number you need to look through.</p>
    </p>Advanced search options allow you to look for your search terms within a particular part of the details associated with each item, e.g. author or subject. You can use these to hone your search so that it gives you the most relevant results.</p
